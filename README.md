# BC Law Library Facebook feed
Displays a public Facebook feed as a set of cards.

Requires JQuery, Masonry with the Images Loaded script (http://masonry.desandro.com/, http://masonry.desandro.com/layout.html#imagesloaded) and AnchorMe (https://github.com/alexcorvi/anchorme.js).

Due to changes to the Facebook Graph API in Spring 2018, a second version of this component was developed which requires fewer API calls.
